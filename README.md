Programming assessment of Res** company.

PowerCurve.csv, SiteData.csv, SiteEnergy.csv, WindData.csv are the dataset I was given.
I chose Polynomial regression and Univariate spline for models. They accomplished accuracy of 89% and 100%, respectively.
Models predicted energy from wind and compared the energy with the actual energy production data.
